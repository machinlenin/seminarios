# About

This repository will hopefully centralize all materials, slides, pdfs and code shared and learned at the Machine Learning Seminar. The seminar is currently hosted in the [Instituto de Calculo de Buenos Aires](www.ic.fcen.uba.ar), located in the [Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (UBA)](https://exactas.uba.ar/). We are open to other hosts if possible!
